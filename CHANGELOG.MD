## [0.8.0]

### Changed
- Public: Deprecated `MESSAGE_IDENTIFY_VERIFICATION` `FlowStep`, since it is too specific for the purpose of the SDK, which should stay as generic as possible
- Public: Changed the default flow, accessible through `FlowStep.getDefaultFlow()` to include a welcome step, also accessible as `FlowStep.WELCOME`
- Public: Document capture step, accessible through `FlowStep.CAPTURE_DOCUMENT` now features 3 different screens. First, a document type selection screen is shown, followed by a country selection screen
for the document origin country to be chosen. Finally, the camera screen for the document capture

message is shown in case it is `null`
- Internal: If country and document type selected is India and national id card, only the front of the document will be asked of the user. There was a mistake where this behaviour was happening with the driver's license instead.

### Removed

which information they want to show on the screen.

## [0.7.1]

- Internal: Crash On RuntimeException for "Could not find requested camera". A message is now presented to the user in such cases, letting him know the camera is not available.
- Internal: Crash On RuntimeException for "takePicture failed". A message is now presented to the user when this happens.
- Internal: Crash on IllegalArgumentException for "meteringAreas is invalid NumFocusAreas must < 4". For devices that have a limit on the number of areas a safeguard clause was added to the code.

### Removed
